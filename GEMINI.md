# GEMINI.md

This file provides guidance for the Gemini CLI agent to follow when working in this repository.

## Guidelines for Commits:

When a git commit is created as a result of direct code generation or significant modification by the Gemini CLI agent, please follow these rules:

1.  **Subject Line**: Do NOT include a trailing dot (period) at the end of the subject line.
2.  **Attribution**: The commit message must include the phrase "Generated by Gemini." on its own separate line in the commit body (separated from the subject or description by a blank line).

This helps in tracking the origin of code contributions and maintains consistency in the project's commit history.
