# GEMINI.md

This file provides guidance for the Gemini CLI agent to follow when working in this repository.

## Guidelines for Commits:

When a git commit is created as a result of direct code generation or significant modification by the Gemini CLI agent, please follow these rules:

1.  **Subject Line**: Do NOT include a trailing dot (period) at the end of the subject line.
2.  **Wrapping**: Wrap the commit description body at 80 columns.
3.  **Attribution**: The commit message must include the phrase "Generated by Gemini." on its own separate line in the commit body (separated from the subject or description by a blank line).

This helps in tracking the origin of code contributions and maintains consistency in the project's commit history.

## Documentation Maintenance:

*   **Update README**: Ensure that `README.md` is updated to reflect the current state of the project with every code change. If a feature is added, removed, or modified, the documentation must be immediately updated to match reality.

## Security and Privacy:

*   **Privacy First**: Always prefer client-side solutions (e.g., `localStorage`) over server-side storage for calling sensitive user data.
*   **Input Sanitization**: When rendering user-provided content (like CSV data), valid HTML escaping must be applied to prevent XSS attacks. Verify this by creating a test case with malicious input.
